For Logistic Regression File:
This code requires numpy and sklearn to run.

For Learning and Testing both rum Logistic_predict.py
For K Fold validation Run k_fold.py

There are four variants of Naive Bayes as follows:

Note: Your current directory should contain the follwoing two files:
classification.csv
classification_test.csv

1. naive_bayes_scikit.py 
This script implements the scikit learn functions 
Run as:
python naive_bayes_scikit.py

2. naive_bayes_gaussian.py
This script implements the case A as explained in the report
Run as:
python naive_bayes_gaussian.py

3. naive_bayes_gauss_ber.py
This script implements the case B as explained in the report
Run as:
python naive_bayes_gauss_ber.py

4. k_fold_all_gauss.py
This script implements the k-fold validation as explained in the report
Run as:
python k_fold_all_gauss.py
Note: Open the script and uncomment the appropriate dataset for training and validation

Credits: Some functions have been used from the scikit learn library and its example code for 1.

For Regression Problem: (Y2)
This code requires numpy and sklearn to run.

All the arguments are provided for this code thus in order to run it you just simply run the

python file.

in terminal use:

python linearReg.py
